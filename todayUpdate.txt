Hello @Harshil Bodara sir,
Here are the latest updates for the Facebook Frontend project as of  May 09, 2025:
List of Completed Tasks:
    1) I have Implemented the password reset functionality using Nodemailer to send an OTP (One-Time Password) for authentication. This allows users to securely reset their password. [Done]
    2) I have  Developed the FriendProfile component, which displays the selected friend's profile details. [Done]
    
    3) I have Enhanced the UserProfile page to fetch and display data in the profile list.Added a "More" options menu (represented by three dots) to allow users to edit or delete their Posts.
        -Delete: Successfully removed posts from both the Redux state and the database.
        -Edit: Enabled users to update profile captions, and changes are reflected both in the database and Redux state. [Completed]
    4) I have Implemented a comprehensive Friend Page feature with four tabs for organizing friend-related data:
        -Sent Requests: Displays all the sent friend requests.
        -Pending Requests: Shows requests that are yet to be accepted.
        -Received Requests: Lists incoming friend requests.
        -Friend Suggestions: Displays suggestions for potential new friends.

    
Thanks!
